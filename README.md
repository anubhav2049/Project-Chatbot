A chatbot still under development. Currently, very simplistic and limited in functionality, with only a handful of questions possible. Going to extend as I keep working on it. 

Version 2: Updated functionality with natural language processing. Added 'preprocess' script so chatbot can handle slightly more complex language. Still only can process basic commands, but now can tokenize from phrases and sentences. Updated from just one word commands. Now can process commands and reply to commands like "What's your name". Plan to add more functionality and extend this.
